This is a kernal task:

Development Test
Completion and delivery of this test twenty-four (24) hours of submitting your application is required.


Instructions:


Here is the hypothetical scenario: the client, Slicedbread, is looking to build a private directory on an exclusive server that allows their development team to post projects for testing purposes and for clients to see the work in progress. 


All client projects will be uploaded into this directory and each project will be named according to the project name (ie. /project1, /project2, etc.). The directory all of these projects will live in will be called /client-portal. 


For this test, build a portal that achieves the following:


A single landing page (using any available signage/branding you see on our current website) that requests for a username/password.
Username: test
Password: portal


The landing page should be tastefully branded and using the same design language as established on the Slicedbread website. (This page will also need to be desktop and mobile responsive) 


Username/password validation should ping the server and provide back a response via AJAX. 
If login is successful, “LOGIN SUCCESSFUL” should appear via AJAX momentarily before directing the user to the next page. 
If login is unsuccessful, an error message stating “LOGIN UNSUCCESSFUL” should appear via AJAX. 


Any pages within sub-directories should be inaccessible if the user has not logged in the past 15 minutes. If a user has not logged within the last 15 minutes, they should be directed to this landing page. 


Upon completion of the project, please commit this to a git repository created by you and upload your work to a server we can access by URL.


When you have fully completed the test, please send us a link to the live application and to your GIT repository.
