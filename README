1. Intall
Launch install.php to create database structure;

2. Structure
I have made php program on nginx with structure:

 - engine
 - client_portal
 - index.php

In index php there is bootstrap template, welcoming page. 

After you login POST request goes to engine/login.php (There is protection on POST\GET requests)
In login.php root.php starts class root and checks login and pass(md5) from mysqli database if finds any matches, sets login and pass to SESSION. 
 
Session lifetime param is set to 900. (15 min)

After correct login page redirects to account.php (Here we protect file by SESSION check if SESSION login is incorrect redirect to main and die)

all project files are in client_portal folder and protected from direct launch, the same as other files.
